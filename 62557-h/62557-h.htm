OBSERVATORY</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><b>VICTORIA, B.C.</b></span></p>

<p class="center">By J. S. PLASKETT, Director.</p>



<h2 class="nobreak">SECTION 1.&mdash;HISTORY AND CONSTRUCTION</h2></div>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This description of the observatory, its equipment and
work has been written by the director in response to a need,
frequently expressed by the numerous visitors to the institution,
of a non-technical account of the principles of the
telescope and of the work of the institution. This account
will commence by a short historical sketch of the beginnings
of the undertaking followed by a description of the observatory
and telescope and concluded by a resume of its work.</p>


<h3>Historical Sketch</h3>

<p>This observatory is a branch of the Department of the
Interior of the Federal Government, the department which
has charge of the administration of the western lands of the
Dominion. In the colonization of these lands, one of the
obvious first needs was a survey of the boundaries and subdivision
into townships and sections. This need led to the
organization of a surveys branch of the department and out
of the necessity of accurate astronomical observations to
delimit the boundaries and define the position of the base
lines for subdivision work arose the astronomical branch.
The first Chief Astronomer of Canada, the late Dr. W. F.
King, was a man of sterling integrity and remarkable ability
and to his genius must be ascribed in large degree the present
development of astronomy in Canada. As Chief Astronomer
and H. M. Commissioner of International Boundaries, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
early realized the need of an observatory for an initial meridian,
for housing and standardizing the instruments, and for some
astronomical research. He was successful in having the fine
Dominion Observatory erected on the Experimental Farm,
Ottawa, in 1905 which housed the Astronomical Branch,
the staff of the International Boundary Surveys and later
the Geodetic Survey of Canada, of which he was the first
superintendent.</p>

<p>The Dominion Observatory was equipped with a 15-inch
refractor provided with micrometer, photometer, solar and
stellar cameras, and spectrograph. The writer was entrusted
with the work with this telescope and the spectroscopic
work especially was energetically developed and helped,
with the other activities of the institution, to bring gratifying
recognition from the scientific world. The need of a larger
aperture for extending this part of the work was soon realized
by the writer and was brought to the attention of the Government.
After some delays, owing to various circumstances,
it was finally decided early in 1913 to provide a large reflector
for extending the work. Enquiries were at once made,
specifications prepared and estimates obtained from prospective
makers of the instrument. Contracts were finally
awarded in October 1913 to the John A. Brashear Co. of
Pittsburgh for the optical parts and to the Warner &amp; Swasey
Co. of Cleveland for the mechanical parts of a 72-inch reflecting
telescope.</p>


<h3>Location</h3>

<p>It was necessary to know the location of the instrument
before the design of the mounting could be completed as the
angle of the polar axis depends upon the latitude of the
site. When the new telescope was first proposed there was
no thought of locating elsewhere than at the seat of government
at Ottawa. However, upon further consideration it
was decided that the telescope should be located where, in
Canada, the best observing conditions prevailed. To determine
this location preliminary selection of five likely stations
was made by the aid of Sir Frederic Stupart, chief of the
Meteorological Service from the meteorological records.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
These stations, at Ottawa, at Medicine Hat, at Banff, at
Penticton, and at Victoria were occupied by Mr. W. E.
Harper, astronomer at Ottawa and the astronomical conditions
were observed by means of a 4.5-inch telescope.
Victoria was unmistakably superior in &#8220;seeing&#8221; or defining
power, in low diurnal and seasonal range of temperature and
about equal so far as quantity of clear sky is concerned. For
such a large telescope as a 72-inch there could be no question
of the marked astronomical advantages of such a location,
and it was therefore decided to locate the telescope at Victoria.
While the observatory should not be in the city itself it should
not be too far away, not only on account of accessibility and
facility in obtaining supplies, but also the advantageous
conditions of good seeing, low diurnal range of temperature
and small rainfall were confined to a relatively small area near
Victoria. An isolated monadnock called locally Little
Saanich Mountain but now named Observatory Hill, was
selected. This hill is about 7 miles north of Victoria and has
a main road and an interurban railway passing its base. It
has an elevation of 730 feet, sufficient area around the summit
for all necessary buildings and was by far the most suitable
site available.</p>


<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>The Provincial Government had generously agreed to
give $10,000 for the purchase of a site and to build a road to
the summit. This undertaking was fully met and the road,
splendidly located and constructed and costing over $25,000,
was completed in the spring of 1915. Contracts for the
construction of the telescope pier and the circular steel walls
of the building were awarded to a local firm and this work
was completed in 1916. The revolving dome with accessories
for the operation of the telescope was made by the Warner
&amp; Swasey Co., the builders of the telescope mounting, and
was completed and erected in 1916, thus making the building
ready for the telescope.</p>

<p>The design of the mounting was very carefully gone into
by the Warner &amp; Swasey Co. in collaboration with the writer
and was completed in the autumn of 1914. Construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was at once begun and the mounting was completed and
temporarily erected at Cleveland in May 1916. It was then
shipped to Victoria and permanently erected in its building
by November 1916.</p>

<p>The order for the large disc for the 72-inch mirror and for
an auxiliary flat of 55 inches diameter for testing the 72-inch
was given to the St. Gobain Glass Works of Paris by the
Jno. A. Brashear Co. as soon as the contract was awarded.
The 72-inch disc was cast and annealed by June 1914 and
was fortunately shipped at once without waiting for the
55-inch disc. It left Antwerp only about a week before war
was declared and it was only by this small margin that Canada
now has a 72-inch telescope. Grinding and polishing were
at once begun but the lack of the large flat and other difficulties
delayed the completion and it was not until April 1918, about
a year and a half after the completion of the mounting, that
the figuring was finally completed and the telescope ready for
work. Nevertheless, for an undertaking of such magnitude
the work was completed in record time, four and a half years
after the awarding of the contracts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SECTION 2.&mdash;THE BUILDING AND DOME</h2></div>


<h3>The Observatory Building</h3>

<p>The building for housing a large reflecting telescope requires
to be of special design for the best results. It should not
rise above the shade temperature during the day and should
rapidly assume and follow the external temperature at night.
Such materials as brick or stone are obviously not suitable and
all recent telescope buildings are entirely of metallic construction
in order to assume quickly the night temperature,
and of double-walled, ventilated type to prevent overheating
from the sun&#8217;s rays. The building for the 72-inch telescope
is entirely of steel construction, circular in form, 66 feet in
external diameter and with vertical walls 32 feet high. A
view from the south is given in the Frontispiece and from the
north in Fig. 1, showing the city of Victoria and the straits of
Juan de Fuca in the background. An external and internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
covering of galvanized iron separated by about 16 inches allows
free circulation of air from a peripheral opening at the base
up through a similar double walled dome and out of louvres
at the top. The ground floor of Terrazo is laid directly on
the rock base and the observing floor 22 feet above this is
formed of steel girders and checkered steel plate. In the
centre of the ground floor rises the massive pier to support
the telescope, of reinforced concrete and symmetrical tapering
form. The pier is actually double, united below the observing
floor by a massive reinforced arch and extending above the
floor as two piers (see Fig. 2) one for each end of the polar
axis. Temporary partitions on the ground floor provide a
dark room, sleeping room, and temporary office quarters.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;OBSERVATORY BUILDING FROM THE NORTH</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h3>The Dome</h3>

<p>This circular steel building is capped by a circular plate
supported by massive girders on which is placed a curved
railroad iron rail turned and adjusted perfectly level and
circular. The hemispherical dome turns on this rail on 24
massive wheels mounted on roller bearings and is rotated by
an electric motor mechanism operated by reversing switches
on each side of the south pier. The framework of this dome,
which is 66 feet in external diameter and about 38 feet high,
the lower 5 feet being cylindrical, consists essentially of a
circular base to which the bearing wheels are attached and
two double, very deep and rigid main ribs, one of which can
be seen in Fig. 3, 16 feet apart in the clear and extending
parallel to each other entirely across the dome. These are
united 6 feet beyond the zenith by a cross girder and this
opening, which can be revolved to any azimuth and can be
closed by double motor operated shutters, enables the telescope
to observe at any part of the sky. Auxiliary circular ribs
reaching from the base ring up to the main ribs all around the
dome except at the shutter opening, form the support for the
double steel covering of 12 inches separation. This ventilating
space is united through suitable weather guards with the
space between the building walls and forms the protection
against overheating by the sun in the day time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h3>Dome Accessories</h3>

<p>The shutter opening 16 feet wide and extending from the
base of the dome to 6 feet beyond the zenith is closed by a
double shutter also double walled and ventilated. Canvas
screens mounted on tubes and operated by motor can be run
up from the base of the shutter opening, this one being shown
in Fig. 3, and down from the top so as to limit the opening to
the width of the tube of the telescope. These screens are
necessary when the wind is blowing to prevent shaking of the
tube and consequent jumping of the star image. For enabling
the observer to reach conveniently the upper end of the
telescope tube in any position a counterweighted elevating
platform, moved up and down the shutter opening by motor
and drum with lifting cables is provided. This platform is 20
feet long and 4 feet wide with a wing at each end, extending
inwards about 6 feet, on which the observer can stand and
can move it and himself by a hand wheel up to and partly
encircling the telescope tube. The platform and movable
wings, which are well shown in Fig. 3, can be brought to any
desired height by an operating switch at one side and can be
reached by an auxiliary stairway from a small stationary
platform attached to the base ring of the dome. This stationary
platform is reached from the observing floor by a permanent
stairway moving with the dome and extending to a foot
from the floor. Platform wings and stairways are made safe
for observers by guard and hand rails 30 inches high. This
moving platform, an essential accessory for direct photography
and other work at the principal focus of the telescope,
meets, in a more convenient and satisfactory manner than
any other previous device for the purpose, all the observing
requirements for work at the upper end of the tube.</p>


<h3>Mechanism for Silvering</h3>

<p>In order to renew the silver coating on the upper surface
of the mirror, which is necessary about three times a year,
mechanism has to be provided for handling the mirror and
its cell, the lower section of the telescope tube, with ease and
safety. The mirror weighs over 2 tons and the cell 4 tons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
so 6 tons have to be removed from and replaced on the telescope
tube. This is effected by means of the silvering car, which
can be seen at the left of Fig. 2, a massive framework of
structural steel rolling on four flanged wheels on flush tracks
in the observing floor. With the tube turned to a vertical
position, the car is rolled from its normal position at the
east side of the dome directly under the tube and a motor-operated
screw-jack surmounted by a triangular rocking
arm can be brought up against the bottom of the cell. On
removing the attaching bolts, cell and mirror can be lowered
and rolled on the car to the east out of the way. The removal
of 6 tons from one side throws the telescope out of balance and
so the outboard end of the declination axis is supported by a
counterweighted strut run up through the floor and the
upper end of the tube tied to rings at the top of the dome.
With a band of paraffined paper tied around the edge of the
mirror and a plug in the central hole, the silvering solution
can be poured on and evenly flowed over the surface by
rocking on a steel ball at the top of the jack-screw. When the
silvering is complete, cell and mirror are replaced in the reverse
order and the car rolled back out of the way. The operation
takes about a day and is performed with perfect safety and ease.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SECTION 3.&mdash;MECHANICAL PARTS OF TELESCOPE</h2></div>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>It is useful, before describing the mechanical parts or
mounting of the telescope, to explain the difference between
the two kinds of telescope, refracting and reflecting, employed
in astronomical work. The refracting telescope is the most
familiar type as the ordinary spyglass or draw-tube telescope
and the field or opera glass are all refracting telescopes. The
refracting telescope is so called because the light from the
distant object is refracted through a lens at the outer end of
the tube and forms an image of the object at the inner end,
just as a camera forms an image on the ground glass or film,
and this image is viewed and magnified by the eyepiece or
ocular. The reflecting telescope on the other hand has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
upper or outer end of the tube open and the light from the
distant object is reflected (hence the name) from a concave
mirror at the lower end of the tube, forming the image of
the object at the top, where it can be viewed and magnified
by the ocular as in the refractor.</p>

<p>Each type of telescope has its astronomical advantages and
disadvantages. The refractor is better suited for visual
observations such as the measurement of double stars and the
study of planetary detail and is less affected by temperature
changes than the reflector. On the other hand the reflector,
on account of its perfect achromatism, is the instrument par
excellence for photographic observations, and, as more than
three-fourths of modern astronomical work is photographic,
it appears to be superseding the refractor. This advantage is
increased by the fact that the refractor has apparently reached
the useful limit in size and that it costs at least three times
as much as a reflector of the same aperture. Although each
type of telescope has its characteristic type of mounting for
astronomical purposes, the principles are the same for each
and can probably be most easily followed by describing the
essential parts of the mounting of the 72-inch telescope.</p>


<h3>The Telescope Tube</h3>

<p>The tube performs the important function of carrying in
relatively invariable position and adjustment the optical
parts of the telescope. The tube of the 72-inch telescope is
31 feet long, 7 feet 4 inches outer diameter and weighs 15
tons. Its form and construction are well shown in Figs. 2
and 3. It consists of the main or central section A, Fig. 2
the lower section B which carries the main mirror and the
skeleton section C which carries the secondary mirrors.
The central section is a cylindrical steel casting heavily
ribbed on the inside about 6 feet high and weighs 7 tons.
The lower section is securely bolted to it through the flanges
shown and with the mirror and its supporting mechanism
weighs about 6 tons. The upper skeleton section is built
up of structural steel, 3 inch I beams, firmly braced and
rivetted together in the manner shown in the figures. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
special feature of this skeleton tube, making it more rigid
than any previous design, consists of the diagonal tension rods
in each rectangular compartment screwed up each to a tension
of about 2,000 pounds, so that the whole tube is under tension
in every position. This stiffness is essential for the proper
performance of the optical parts, as the principal and secondary
mirrors at bottom and top of tube respectively should
occupy the same relative positions in whatever direction the
tube is pointed.</p>


<h3>The Declination Axis</h3>

<p>The telescope tube is firmly screwed at right angles to the
flanged end of a massive shaft 16 inches in diameter, called
the declination axis, extending through the cubical section
D of the polar axis NDS, Fig. 2, through the declination
sleeve E into the housing F. This declination axis is rotated,
carrying the tube with it, on ball bearings in D and F, this
rotation being effected by an electric motor with reduction
mechanism, gearing into a large spur gear attached to the
end of the declination axis, the whole being concealed within
the declination housing F. Hence the tube can be turned at
the rate of 45 degrees to the minute to any required position
up or down, north or south. The position in the sky, the
declination, corresponding to latitude on the earth, is read
on a large circle graduated into degrees within F and subdivided
into 5 minute intervals on the small auxiliary circle H.</p>


<h3>The Polar Axis</h3>

<p>As positions north or south are given by turning the tube
on the declination axis, so positions east or west are given by
rotation on the polar axis, so called because it points to the pole
of the heavens and is exactly parallel to the axis of the earth.
The Polar axis NDS Fig. 2, which is 21 feet long and weighs
9·5 tons, is built up of three steel castings, a central cubical
section D and two conical end sections, all securely bolted
together and turning in ball bearings on its ends. The
upper, north, bearing is carried in an adjustable pillow block,
by which the final parallelism with the earth&#8217;s axis is obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
bolted on the curved cement pier shown at the left or north in
Figs. 2 and 3. The lower, south, bearing is carried in a
massive cast iron pedestal bolted to the south cement pier.
The polar axis is rotated on these bearings, also at the rate of
45 degrees per minute, carrying the declination axis and tube
with it to any position east or west in the sky by an electric
motor and reduction gearing concealed within the south
pedestal. The position east or west in the sky, the right
ascension as it is called corresponding to longitude on the
earth, is read by means of a graduated circle shown above
G, Fig. 2, which is divided into 24 hours and each hour into
single minutes. While longitudes on the earth are occasionally
expressed as so many hours and minutes east or west of
Greenwich, right ascensions in the sky are almost invariably
given in hours and minutes rather than degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;TELESCOPE FROM THE WEST</p>


<h3>The Driving Clock</h3>

<p>It is evident, by rotation of the telescope on the declination
and polar axes by means of the quick-motion motors, that the
tube can be pointed in any direction in the sky, towards any
star. But owing to the rotation of the earth on its axis from
west to east, which is the cause of the apparent motion of
sun, moon and stars from east to west, the telescope will be
quickly carried eastward of the star which will only remain
for an instant in the field.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the rotation of the earth is
compensated for is called the driving clock and is contained in
the case L, Fig. 2, at the north side of the south pier. In the
lower half of the case a governor similar to the governor of a
steam engine is driven once per second by a train of gears in
the upper section actuated by a weight of 300 pounds below
the floor. If the speed of the governor tends to increase the
balls raise by centrifugal force and bring increased friction to
bear thus reducing the speed to normal while if the speed
tends to decrease, the balls drop and reduced friction quickly
allows it to accelerate to normal speed. A shaft with a coarse
screw thread on it, called technically a &#8220;worm&#8221; and situated
at the top of the case, is driven by intermediate gearing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the governor at the rate of one revolution every two minutes.
The thread on this shaft engages into teeth cut in the worm
wheel G, Fig. 2, which is 9 feet in diameter. As there are
720 teeth very accurately spaced in this worm wheel, it is
driven around by the worm in 2 × 720 = 1,440 minutes, 24
hours, the same rate as the earth. This worm wheel, normally
loose on the polar axis on which it turns on ball bearings,
allowing the axis to be moved freely to any position, can be
rigidly clamped to it by pressing a button. When this is
done, it will evidently turn the polar axis and hence the tube
at the same rate as the earth but in the opposite direction,
on an axis parallel to the axis of the earth, thus exactly compensating
for the rotation of the earth. Hence any star at which
the telescope is pointed will automatically remain central in
the field. Owing to the great magnification all this mechanism
requires the highest grade of workmanship, else there will be
wandering of the image, a most annoying and troublesome
defect. Few telescopes are entirely free from periodic error
and that the 72-inch drives so regularly and smoothly is a
great advantage and evidence of the perfection of workmanship
throughout.</p>


<h3>Electric Motions</h3>

<p>It has already been described how the telescope can be
moved by motors north or south and east or west at the rate of
45 degrees per minute. These motors are operated from small
switchboards on each side of the south pier, the one at the
west being seen in Figs. 2 and 3. The left-hand reversing
switch moves the telescope east or west, the centre switch
north or south and the right-hand switch revolves the dome
east or west. In addition to these quick motions of the
telescope for rapidly bringing it to the approximate position,
much finer and slower motions are required for bringing the
image exactly central and for guiding. These slow motions
are also operated by electric motors actuated by two small
aluminium switchboards attached by flexible cables to the
top and bottom of the tube. These switchboards can be
carried in the hands of the observer or rested on the observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ladder. Pressure on suitable buttons moves the telescope
north or south, east or west at either one of two different
speeds, a speed of one revolution in 36 hours for centering the
image and a speed of one revolution in 30 days for guiding,
correcting for slight irregularities due to air disturbance or
other causes. Although these speeds may seem excessively
slow, the motion of the image even with the monthly rate is
at once evident on pressing the button and faster speeds
would make accurate guiding difficult. In addition to the
two quick and two slow motion motors there are two clamping
motors and one for automatically rewinding the clock weight,
seven in all. These with the three motors operating the dome
are all continuous current motors which can be started and
reversed more readily and have greater initial torque than
alternating motors. Each motor is supplied with an automatic
control, so that all that is necessary is to throw the
switch or press the button to start or reverse. Current is
supplied by a motor generator set on the ground floor.</p>


<h3>Method of Operation</h3>

<p>A description of the method of setting upon the required
star, when, for example, photographing the spectra of the
stars, will help to make the operation of the telescope more
clearly understood. It is easily possible to pull the telescope
around by hand to the required star identified by eye among
the constellations. Although the moving parts of the telescope
weigh nearly 45 tons, so perfect are the ball bearings in which
it turns that a weight of 3 pounds at the upper end of the tube
is sufficient to set it in motion. However the settings can be
much more quickly and certainly made by turning the telescope
to the right ascension and declination of the star by the
electrical motions. A programme of the stars to be observed
with their right ascensions and declinations is prepared beforehand.
The observing assistant stands beside the small
switchboard on the south pier and rapidly moves the telescope
east or west and north or south until the indexes on the
graduated circles point to the tabulated positions, while the
dome can be turned to the required position at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by means of the third operating switch. By pressing two
buttons the telescope is then firmly clamped and the driving
clock starts the telescope automatically following the star.
In the meantime the observer has inserted the plate holder in
the spectrograph and drawn the slide and by means of the
aluminium switchboard brings the star, which is generally
near the centre, exactly to the centre of the finder, when it
will be visible on the slit of the spectrograph through a guiding
eyepiece and can quickly be brought central and the exposure
commenced. The time required from the end of one exposure
to the beginning of the next, unless the stars are far apart in
the sky, does not generally exceed two minutes, a shorter
time than usually required for even quite small telescopes.
This rapid operation is due to special care in design and
construction and markedly increases the efficiency and
capacity of the instrument.</p>


<h3>Special Features of the Mounting</h3>

<p>The mounting of the 72-inch telescope has several new
features not hitherto used and sets a new standard for convenience
and accuracy of operation. The observatory is
much indebted to the Warner &amp; Swasey Co., who have made
most of the large mountings in America, for the spirit in which
they undertook and carried through this work. Their sole
object was to produce the best possible mounting regardless
of cost and no suggestion of the writer looking to improvement
was refused. To Mr. Swasey, the president, are due many of
the original features of the mounting and the beauty and
harmony of the design, while Mr. Burrell, the works manager,
is responsible for the simplification of the mechanism and the
beautiful co-ordination of the details. No greater testimony
to the perfection of design and construction can be given
than to say that after five years use there is no feature the
director would wish changed, and no single defect of construction
has been revealed.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note the principal improvements in
this mounting.</p>

<p>1. All parts of the sky can be readily reached. This is not
possible with all types of reflecting telescopes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>2. The elimination of cylindrical bearings with cumbrous
friction-relieving devices, formerly considered necessary for
maintaining collimation and adjustment on declination and
polar axes, and the use of ball bearings for both friction-relieving
and collimating purposes has resulted in remarkable
ease of movement of the telescope.</p>

<p>3. Freedom from periodic or other errors in driving and
smoothness and freedom from &#8220;backlash&#8221; in slow motions.</p>

<p>4. Ease, speed and accuracy with which settings can be
made due to careful design and original features in setting
motors and setting circles.</p>

<p>5. Great stiffness of tube and improvements in method of
attaching and changing secondary mirrors.</p>

<p>6. Beauty and harmony of design and appearance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SECTION 4.&mdash;OPTICAL PARTS AND SPECTROGRAPHS</h2></div>


<h3>The Principal Mirror</h3>

<p>The great mirror is composed of hard plate glass cast in
one piece and after annealing, ground and polished to the
correct shape. As received from the St. Gobain Co., the disc
was 73·5 inches diameter, over 13 inches thick with a central
hole about 6 inches diameter and weighed nearly 5,000 pounds.
It was first of all ground truly circular to a diameter of 73
inches and flat on both sides to a thickness of slightly over
12 inches, while the central hole was enlarged to 10 inches.
When the back was polished approximately flat, the disc
was seen to be a beautiful specimen of the glass makers art,
homogeneous and almost entirely free from bubbles or other
defects.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;PHOTOGRAPH OF RING NEBULA IN LYRA<br />

(<i>Enlarged 8 diameters</i>)</p>

<p>It was now ready for the second stage of the operation the
grinding of the correct shape for the upper reflecting surface.
In order to bring the light of a star to an accurate focus this
surface must be a paraboloid of revolution, the same kind of
curve given to the reflectors of search lights or automobile
headlights. The curve for this reflector of 30 feet focus is
very nearly a section of a sphere of 60 feet radius, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
one-thousandth of an inch, and consequently would nearly
fit a huge globe 120 feet in diameter. The upper surface of
the disc was fine ground and polished to this spherical surface
and was then ready for the final stage, the &#8220;figuring&#8221; a continuation
of the polishing process until the centre is deepened
about a thousandth of an inch and the surface becomes
accurately paraboloidal. This &#8220;figuring,&#8221; an exceedingly
delicate and difficult process especially over such a large
surface as the 72-inch, with the added difficulty of a central
hole, occupied about two years and was not completed until
nearly a year and a half after the mounting was ready. When
it is remembered, however, that the surface nowhere deviates
from the true theoretical form more than one four-hundred-thousandth
of an inch and that if one part is accidentally
polished too deep, the whole surface has again to be brought
down to this level, the exceeding delicacy of the operation is
evident and the time taken not excessive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Accurate quantitative tests showed that the final figure is
of the highest order of accuracy and this is further clearly
shown by the practical test of direct photographs at the
principal focus. Figure 4, a six fold enlargement of a photograph
at the principal focus, of the Ring Nebula in Lyra
shows how sharp and small are the star images. Actual
measurement on the original negative gives a minimum
diameter of two one-thousandths of an inch equivalent to
only a second of arc at the focus. As the images are enlarged
considerably by unsteadiness of the air and errors in guiding
the star light reflected from the whole surface of the mirror
is collected into a little disc less than a thousandth of an inch
in diameter indicating the extraordinary accuracy of the
reflecting surface. Mr. J. B. McDowell, head of the firm
since Dr. Brashear&#8217;s death, and Mr. Fred Hegemann, his
chief optician, are to be highly congratulated on the perfection
of figure obtained under specially difficult circumstances.
Further the fine rendering of the detail in the
ring and the strength of the two bands in the interior indicate
not only perfect figure but exceptionally high polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>Mounting of Mirror</h3>

<p>This mirror, to maintain its accuracy, not only requires
careful mounting in its cell but also protection against temperature
changes. Even though 12 inches thick it would bend
under its own weight of 4,300 lbs. sufficiently to affect the
figure and consequently it is supported in the cell by a specially
counterweighted lever system so that it is equably supported
at twelve points and there is no tendency to bend. A similar
lever support system around the edge prevents distortion
due to constraint when it is tipped from the horizontal position
at different positions of the tube. Temperature changes can
produce much greater distortion than flexure but Victoria
has the advantage of very low diurnal range and the temperature
change around the mirror is made very small by a lagging
of cotton felt about 2 inches thick all round the sides of the
closed section of the tube, laced on with a duck cover (compare
Fig. 3 with Fig. 2) and an equal thickness below and around
the edge of the mirror. By this lagging the temperature rise
in the day-time is only about half a degree while the dome
temperature increases five degrees, hence the figure of the
mirror remains good whatever the temperature changes
outside.</p>


<h3>The Principal Focus</h3>

<p>As already indicated, the principal mirror when used alone
forms an image of the star 30 feet above, at the centre of
the upper end of the tube, and an eyepiece could be placed
there for visual work or a photographic plate for direct photographs
of nebulae, etc. However, it is generally more convenient
to use a flat mirror at 45° forming the image at the
side of the tube for photographs and so the telescope is only
used in this form with a small spectrograph for the ultra-violet
region of star spectra. The course of the parallel
beam of light from the star to its image on the slit of the
spectrograph is graphically shown in Fig. 5 A and also its
passage through the slit prisms and lenses of the spectrograph.
The position of the star image on the slit of the
spectrograph can be observed by a guiding telescope extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to the edge of the tube and can be kept central by the portable
aluminium switchboard already described. The elevating
platform is of course used in work in this position.</p>


<h3>The Newtonian Arrangement</h3>

<p>For direct photography or visual observations at the focus
of the 72-inch mirror, the reflected cone of star light from the
mirror B, Fig. 5, is intercepted by a plane mirror also silvered
on the front surface, 19·5 inches diameter and 3·25 inches
thick placed at 45°. This form of reflecting telescope was
first used by Newton, hence the name. The focus is then
formed, as shown, at the side of the tube, and if a plate is
placed there and accurately guided by small eyepieces with
cross wires, photographs of any desired small region in the
sky can be obtained, Fig. 4 being made in this position, or
visual observations may be made. The oculars can easily be
reached from the observing platform for any position of the
telescope.</p>


<h3>The Cassegrain Arrangement</h3>

<p>The most generally useful arrangement of the 72-inch
telescope is, however, the Cassegrain form, so called from
the French astronomer who first used it. About 7 feet below
the focus, the conical reflected pencil from the 72-inch mirror
is intercepted by a convex mirror of the same size as the
Newtonian and of about 10 feet focal length as seen in C,
Fig. 5, and also shown in Fig. 2 and 3. This mirror turns the
light downward and, after passing through the central hole,
forms the image of the star about two feet below the mirror
surface on the slit of the spectrograph or on a visual attachment
as shown. The significant property of this combination
is that the focal length is increased from 30 to 108 feet without
changing the tube length in a somewhat similar manner to
the action of a telephoto lens. It has the same size of image
and magnifying power as a refractor with a tube 108 feet long
and has the decided advantage of a much shorter tube and
smaller dome. Observations with this arrangement are
made at the lower end of the tube from the observing floor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with much greater ease and convenience than at the upper
end. Changes from the Cassegrain to the Newtonian or
Principal Focus arrangements are readily effected by a device
due to the genius of Mr. Swasey whereby only the mirrors
and attaching tubes require to be handled, instead of the
whole upper end of the tube as in previous reflectors.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;COURSE OF LIGHT IN TELESCOPE FROM STAR TO FOCUS</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h3>Accessory Optical Parts</h3>

<p>A full set of eyepieces giving magnifying powers from 120
to 5,000 diameters and a complete double-slide plate holder
with guiding eyepieces for direct photography at the Newtonian
focus are provided. In addition there is a visual
attachment shown in diagram C, Fig. 5, which enables the
telescope to be used visually at the Cassegrain focus without
removing the spectrograph. There are three finders attached
to the telescope tube for picking up and centering the stars.
Two of 4 inch aperture and 5 feet focus, of power about 50,
one north, one south on the tube, and a long focus tubeless
finder with a lens of 7 inch aperture and 30 feet focus at the
top of the telescope tube and an ocular of power 200 at the
bottom.</p>


<h3>The Spectrographs</h3>

<p>Most of the astronomical work with the 72-inch telescope
is spectroscopic, photographing the spectra of the stars, and
so a description of the principles and operation of spectrographs
is desirable. Stellar spectrographs have evolved into
certain definite forms and the two spectrographs for the
72-inch telescope are examples of the most recent types. In
essence a spectrograph consists of a narrow slit, one or two-thousandths
of an inch wide, on which the star light is focussed.
That passing through the slit falls on the collimator lens which
makes it parallel and then on a prism or prisms, triangular
shaped pieces of glass which change the direction of the
light and decompose it, breaking it up into its constituent
rainbow colours. The spectrum, as it is called, is focussed
by a camera lens on a photographic plate or can be viewed
by a small telescope if desired. The course of the star light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from the slit through collimator, prism and camera lens to
the plate is shown in C, Fig. 5, while a view of the Cassegrain
spectrograph showing the interior mechanism and accessories
is given in Fig. 6. The part of the spectrum photographed
is usually only the blue and violet region to which the ordinary
plate is most sensitive, and obviously no colours appear on
the negative but only a narrow dark strip which is crossed by
light or dark lines. It is from the number and position of
these lines that we obtain such a remarkable amount of
information about the physical and chemical constitution,
the temperature, motion and distance of the stars. The
length of the star spectrum photographed with one prism is
about one and a third inches, twice and three times that with
two and three prisms. Its width is about one-hundredth of
an inch and in order to make it this wide the star image has
to be moved back and forward along the slit. The length of
spectrum with the ultra-violet spectrograph, which only
differs from the other in the prisms and lenses allowing the
spectrum below the violet to pass, is about one inch. A
photograph of the spectrum of iron or brass is made beside
the star spectrum to serve as a standard to determine the
positions of the star lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;STELLAR SPECTROGRAPH ARRANGED FOR USE WITH ONE PRISM<br />

(TEMPERATURE CASE REMOVED)</p>


<h3>Method of Use</h3>

<p>Every terrestrial element gives groups of lines in certain
positions in the spectrum and if we find similar groups in the
star spectrum we are sure this element is present in the star.
Further if we find these lines are displaced to red or violet of
their normal position we know that the star is receding from
or approaching to us. With the one-prism spectrograph a
speed of one mile per second means a displacement of the
lines of one thirty-thousandth of an inch. Thus if the lines
are shifted to the violet by a thousandth of an inch, the star
is approaching the earth with a speed of 30 miles a second.
These displacements are accurately measured by a microscope
and the measurement of the radial velocities of the stars is
one of the main researches of this observatory. Obviously
with such small displacements to be measured the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
care must be taken to avoid all sources of error. The spectrograph
must be exceptionally rigid to avoid differential bending
as it moves with the telescope. As change of temperature can
produce spurious shifts of the lines, the temperature must be
kept as constant as possible, this being effected here by a
very accurate electrical thermostatic device called the Calendar
Recorder which maintains the temperature constant
to one-hundredth of a degree. The optical parts must be of
the highest quality to give perfect definition to the spectrum
lines and many other precautions must be taken if accurate
work is desired. The spectrographs of the 72-inch telescope
have unequalled defining power and are the last word in
convenience of manipulation and accuracy of work.</p>

<p>Owing to the faintness of the star light and to its being
spread out into a spectrum a considerable time is required to
photograph the spectrum of a star, about 20 minutes for the
sixth magnitude, the limit of visibility to the unaided eye,
when photographed with one prism, while three prisms will
take nearly five times as long. Hence the necessity and use
of large telescopes is not to get high magnifying power but to
collect sufficient light from the fainter stars to enable their
spectra to be photographed or other observations made.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">SECTION 5.&mdash;THE WORK OF THE TELESCOPE</h2></div>


<h3>Prevalent Misconceptions</h3>

<p>The general idea of an astronomer&#8217;s work, as gathered
from the questions and remarks of visitors, is that he sits at
the eyepiece of the telescope sweeping the heavens in a search
for new planets, comets or stars. The absolute futility of
such a use of the telescope is evident when it is realized that
the main field of the 72-inch covers only about one hundred-millionth
of the sky and if only five seconds was required to
examine each field it would take more than a lifetime to go
over the whole sky once. A second misconception is the idea
that large telescopes are used for visual observations of the
planets with special reference to their habitability. No
work is being attempted at this or other large observatories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on planetary detail for which about an 18-inch refractor gives
the best results and such a large telescope as the 72-inch is
quite unsuited. All scientific observations with the 72-inch
are made photographically and it is only arranged for visual
use on Saturday evenings when for two hours visitors are
allowed to observe the heavenly bodies. A third misconception
is that the astronomer only works at night. However
true this idea may have been in the days of visual observations
when the measurements were made at the eyepiece, there is
certainly now, when photography is so generally applied, more
day than night work in astronomy. Besides the advantages
of permanency, accuracy of measurement and power of recording
objects beyond the range of the keenest eyesight, the
photographic method has the further great advantage that
an hour&#8217;s exposure may give sufficient material for several
days&#8217; measurement and discussion.</p>


<h3>Spectroscopic Work</h3>

<p>As already indicated most of the work with the 72-inch
telescope is spectroscopic, but as also indicated modern
spectroscopic investigations cover so wide a range of research
that the actual work of the observatory is very varied. By
aid of suitable spectrographs attached to a large telescope
we can measure the speed of the stars towards or from us,
their radial velocity as it is termed. We can discover double
stars too close ever to be seen double in any telescope and we
can determine the manner in which they revolve around one
another and their distance apart and mass. From the spectra
of the stars we can determine their absolute brightness as
compared with the sun and their parallax or distance. The
chemical elements present in the outer atmospheres of the
stars can be determined and the pressure in these atmospheres.
The measurement of temperatures and other physical conditions
in the stars by means of the spectroscope is now an
accomplished fact and one of the most recent developments of
the spectroscopic work here has been to provide evidence of
the truth of a theory of atomic structure and to show that the
atomic constants in the enormous furnaces of the stars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the same as on the earth. Such a catalogue of information,
obtained from an investigation of the mere quality of the
light from stars so faint as to be quite invisible to the unaided
eye and so distant that it may take thousands of years to
travel to us, is sufficiently comprehensive to be treated in
more detail.</p>


<h3>Radial Velocities</h3>

<p>When the 72-inch telescope was in course of design and
construction, one of the greatest needs in astronomical work
was increased data in regard to the radial velocities of the
stars. Although the telescope was so designed as to be
suitable for all kinds of observational work, special attention
was devoted to the spectroscopic end. After consultation
with the most prominent astronomers an observing programme
of about 800 stars whose &#8220;proper&#8221; or cross motions across
the sky were accurately known but whose radial velocities
had not been determined, was prepared and spectroscopic
observations of the stars on this programme were commenced
as soon as the telescope was completed in May 1918. After
slightly over three years&#8217; work, observation and measurement
were completed and Vol. II, No. 1 of the observatory
publications, &#8220;The Radial Velocities of 594 Stars,&#8221; was
published early in 1922. As hitherto the radial velocities of
only about 2,000 stars had been obtained, this work was a
considerable addition to existing data about the motions of
the stars and will be of great use in extending our knowledge
of the structure and motions of the universe. A second
programme of 1,500 stars has been prepared but owing to
other intervening observational work, not much has yet been
done on this new programme.</p>

<p>One of the auxiliary programmes undertaken and nearly
completed since the first programme is the determination of
the radial velocities of a very interesting but limited class of
stars, the highest temperature stars known, the O-type stars.
The radial velocities and other interesting data about 50 of
these stars have been completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>Spectroscopic Double Stars</h3>

<p>In the measurement of the radial velocity of the 800 stars
on the first programme it was found that in about 180 stars
successive plates did not give constant velocities, the stars at
one time approaching at another receding from us. This
phenomenon is practically certain proof that we are measuring
the velocity of a star revolving around an invisible companion
and such stars are generally called spectroscopic binaries to
distinguish them from visual binaries which can be seen
double in the telescope. Over 200 spectroscopic binaries
have been discovered at this observatory as compared with
about 700 discovered elsewhere, again a considerable addition.
In about 20 of these binaries, observations were continued
until the period of revolution, the form of the orbit, the
separation of the two stars and in some cases, their masses
were determined. In a particular class of spectroscopic
binaries, the eclipsing variables, which allow from the combination
of spectroscopic and photometric measurements
the absolute dimensions to be obtained, we were able to
determine the separation of the two stars, their diameters,
densities, masses and brightnesses and the probable distances.
Such complete information has been obtained here about
seven systems, while only seven other systems have been
determined elsewhere.</p>


<h3>Absolute Magnitude and Distance</h3>

<p>A new application of spectroscopic methods is to the
determination of the total brightness of the stars as compared
with the sun and their distance or &#8220;spectroscopic parallax&#8221;
as it is called. This depends not on the positions but on the
relative intensity or strength of the lines in the spectra of
the stars and has only been developed in the last three or four
years. The absolute magnitude and spectroscopic parallax
of about 800 stars is now nearly completed and will soon be
published while as a side line the radial velocities of 125 more
stars have been determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3>Physical Conditions in the Stars</h3>

<p>The spectrographs have also been used by one member of
the staff in the determination of the physical and chemical
conditions in stellar atmospheres, a new and difficult problem
but one which promises not only very valuable additions to
our knowledge of the constitution of the stars but may also
lead to economic applications of the greatest importance.
A new method depending upon the use of a wedge of dark
glass has been applied to determining the distribution of
energy in the different parts of the spectrum of the stars and
to measuring their temperatures, while an application of the
same methods to individual lines may lead to a great increase
in our knowledge of conditions in the stars. A special investigation
of three of the high temperature O-type stars referred
to above has proved the existence in the spectra of these
stars of lines predicted as present from purely theoretical
conditions but never previously identified and has thus
remarkably verified a theory of the structure of the atom.
The measurement of the wave lengths of these hitherto
unknown lines has led to an important independent determination
of the fundamental constants of atomic structure and
the dimensions of the atom and has shown that these constants
and dimensions are the same in the tremendous furnaces of
the stars as in our terrestrial laboratories, a verification of
the homogeneity of matter and the uniformity of physical
laws throughout the universe. Further interesting results
from this investigation are the application of a new theory
of ionization with the probable relative abundance of the
elements to an independent determination of the temperature
of these stars.</p>


<h3>Other Investigations</h3>

<p>Direct photographs have been made of some nebulae and
clusters but this work is not being definitely followed at
present. Investigations into the phenomena accompanying
some short period binaries have been made and into the
behaviour of the two strong calcium lines H and K in the
spectra of the high temperature stars from which interesting
and valuable results are expected. Since the observatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
commenced work two bright novae or new stars have appeared,
which have been fully observed spectroscopically here and
the results discussed. The plates of the nova in Aquila have
been loaned to the observatory at the University of Cambridge,
England, for fuller discussion and analysis.</p>


<h3>Value of Astronomical Work</h3>

<p>This brief sketch of the work of the observatory naturally
leads to the question frequently asked of astronomers:&mdash;What
use is the work done at observatories and what practical
value can a knowledge of the stars have in everyday life?
While astronomy has obvious practical applications to navigation
and surveying yet nine-tenths of modern astronomical
research is devoted to the more or less abstract question of the
constitution and motion of the stars and the structure of the
universe. Indeed most physical and chemical as well as
astronomical research is undertaken for the purpose of increasing
our knowledge and of investigating the secrets and laws
of nature and has generally no direct practical economic
application. But it is now generally recognized by the
layman as well as the scientist that without abstract there
can be no applied science and that all the great economic
and industrial applications of science have had to be preceded
by the abstract and apparently non-practical investigations
of pure science. The Great War perhaps made more evident
than ever before the absolute dependence of applied science
upon the unselfish and abstract work of pure science.</p>


<h3>Economic Value</h3>

<p>In view of past experience in science it would hence be
a rash prediction to assert that the investigation of the conditions
in distant stars can have no practical application
upon earth. It may be of interest to point out one possible
application of astrophysical research.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that one of the most important
economic problems of the not far distant future will be the
provision of sources of energy to replace our rapidly depleting
supplies of coal and oil. It appears now that the most probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
solution of this problem will consist in the development of
some method for utilizing the inexhaustible stores of energy
contained in the atoms of matter. Modern research on
conditions in the stars has made it practically certain that the
enormous supply of energy, which has been radiated into space
for aeons of time from these bodies, can only be maintained
undiminished by the energy released by the transformation of
atoms in the interior of the stars, where conditions of temperature
and pressure prevail at present unattainable in terrestrial
laboratories. The most hopeful line of attack upon this
tremendously important economic problem hence seems to lie
in the systematic astrophysical investigation of conditions in
the stars supplemented by physical and chemical researches
on the structure of the atom.</p>


<h3>Ethical Value</h3>

<p>While astronomers and scientific men generally fully
realize the value of the practical applications of science, their
main purpose is the search for truth and the extension of our
knowledge of nature. While it is possible that investigation
of the stars may have immense economic value, it is certain
that it has tremendous ethical value giving us a clearer knowledge
of the laws of nature and of our relations to the wonders
of creation. Astronomy is the oldest and in many respects
the most important of the sciences and its study, through the
ages has been one of the most elevating influences on human
character. Poincaré has well said that if the earth had been
so continuously covered with clouds that the heavenly bodies
could not be seen, mankind would still be in a primitive state
and under the domain of superstition. The main superiority
of modern over ancient civilization does not consist in the
greater abundance of the necessities and luxuries of life,
although this is undoubtedly due primarily to scientific
research, but to the elevating influences of the truer conceptions
